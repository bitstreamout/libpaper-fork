libpaper
========

The paper files and tools provide a simple way for applications to
find information about paper sizes, and to find the user's preferred
default paper size.

It offers a command-line tool and files that applications can easily
use.

See paperinfo(1) for information on the command-line tool, and
paperspecs(5) for how to configure the paper sizes.
