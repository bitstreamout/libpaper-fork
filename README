libpaper
========

The paper library and accompanying tools provide a simple way for
applications to find information about paper sizes, and to find the
user's preferred default paper size.

It offers a command-line tool and simple C library that applications
of all sorts can easily use, and an administrative tool to change the
system default paper size, and inform other interested packages.

See libpaper(3) for how to use the library.


Changing and adding paper sizes
===============================

New paper sizes can be added to /etc/paperspecs (or equivalent if
you have installed libpaper elsewhere). See that file for more
details.
