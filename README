The paper library and accompanying files are intended to provide a simple
way for applications to take actions based on a system- or user-specified
paper size.

It offers really basic functions (obtaining the system paper name and
getting the height and width of a given kind of paper) that
applications can immediately integrate.

See the sources for paperconf(1) in src/paperconf.c for how to use the
library.

Adding new paper sizes
======================

If a paper format is missing, one need to add it to lib/paperspecs.  The
format of this file is one paper format per line, with the name of the
format, the width and height of the format separated with space.  You
may add an option measurement unit among in, ft, pt, m, dm, cm, mm or you
may leave the default unit of "point".  By defaults the width and height
are specified in the "point" unit, which is 1/72 inch (2.54 cm).  This
is the A4 entry:

  a4 210 297 mm
