libpaper
========

The paper files and tools provide a simple way for applications to
find information about paper sizes, and to find the user's preferred
default paper size.

It offers command-line tools and files that applications can easily
use. Other programs can be informed when the system default paper size
is changed.

See paperinfo(1) and paperconfig(1) for information on the
command-line tools, and paperspecs(5) for how to configure the paper
sizes.
