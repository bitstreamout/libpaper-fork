The paper package enables users to indicate their preferred paper
size, provides the paper(1) utility to find the user's preferred
default paper size and give information about known sizes, and
specifies system-wide and per-user paper size catalogues, which can be
can also be used directly (see paperspecs(5)).

The paperconfig(1) utility is provided to allow other systems that have
their own paper size configuration systems paper sizes, such as TeXLive, to
interoperate with paper(1).

Installation
------------

To build, you need the following programs installed, as well as a
standard POSIX environment and C compiler:

  automake, autoconf, git, perl

Then run:

  ./bootstrap && ./configure --enable-relocatable && make && [sudo] make install

The --enable-relocatable option builds paper as a relocatable package that
can be copied anywhere once built and installed. Note that if you do not use
it, the tests (“make check”) will not work.

For installation options, see ./configure --help; see INSTALL for more
information.
