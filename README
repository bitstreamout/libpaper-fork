The paper library and accompanying files are intended to provide a simple
way for applications to take actions based on a system- or user-specified
paper size.

It offers really basic functions (obtaining the system paper name and
getting the height and width of a given kind of paper) that
applications can immediately integrate.

See the sources for paperconf(1) in src/paperconf.c for how to use the
library.

Adding new paper sizes
======================

New paper formats can be added to /etc/paperspecs (or equivalent if
you have installed libpaper elsewhere). See that file for more
details.
