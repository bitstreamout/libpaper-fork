libpaper
========

The paper library and accompanying tools provide a simple way for
applications to find information about paper sizes, and to find the
user's preferred default paper size.

It offers command-line tools and a simple C library that applications
can easily use.  Other programs can be informed when the system
default paper size is changed.

See paperinfo(1) and paperconfig(1) for information on the
command-line tools, libpaper(3) for how to use the library, and
paperspecs(5) for how to configure the paper sizes.
