.TH PAPERSPECS 5 "1 December 2013"
.SH NAME
.B paperspecs
\- paper size specifications
.SH DESCRIPTION
A CSV format list of the paper size specifications used by libpaper.
Each line contains the following fields:
.TP
NAME,WIDTH,HEIGHT,UNIT
.PP
Valid units are: \fBpt\fR (PostScript points), \fBmm\fR, \fBin\fR.
.PP
A size may be defined more than once. Only the first definition is
normally used. This means that the user's paperspecs file overrides
sizes in the system file (see below).
.PP
Multiple definitions are also used to allow inexact definitions to be
looked up by size. For example, the \fBLC_PAPER\fR mechanism available
on some systems defines paper sizes in whole numbers of millimetres,
which results in a definition for Letter size that does not exactly
match the definition in inches.
.SH FILES
.TP
.B @sysconfdir@/@PAPERSPECS@
System list of paper sizes.
.B ~/.@PAPERSPECS@
User's list of paper sizes. This is prepended to the system list.
.SH BUGS
The CSV format is restricted: quotes are not allowed; hence, fields
cannot be escaped.
.SH CREDITS
The original paper names came from Ghostscript 3.68's gs_stadt.ps.
