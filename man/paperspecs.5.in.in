.TH PAPERSPECS 5 "19 November 2013"
.SH NAME
.B paperspecs
\- paper size specifications
.SH DESCRIPTION
A list of the paper size specifications used by libpaper, one per line.
Each line has the format:
.TP
NAME WIDTH HEIGHT UNIT
.PP
Valid units are: \fBpt\fR (PostScript points), \fBmm\fR, \fBin\fR.
.PP
A size may be defined more than once. Only the first definition is
normally used. This means that the user's paperspecs file overrides
sizes in the system file (see below).
.PP
Multiple definitions are also used to allow inexact definitions to be
looked up by size. For example, the \fBLC_PAPER\fR mechanism available
on some systems defines paper sizes in whole numbers of millimetres,
which results in a definition for Letter size that does not exactly
match the definition in inches.
.SH FILES
